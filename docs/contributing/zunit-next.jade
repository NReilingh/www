      ZUnit is in constant development, and as such we need members of the community who are willing to use the most cutting-edge version of ZUnit's codebase and help us improve it with bug reports, suggestions and comments.

      ZUnit's [Github repository](https://github.com/molovo/zunit) will always contain a branch called `next`, which contains the code which will be included in the next official release of ZUnit. As well as this, documentation for the next release will always be live at <https://next.zunit.xyz>.
