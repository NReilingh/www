      Configuring ZUnit is done by editing values in the `.zunit.yml` file, found at the root of your project. Below are details of each of the available configuration options.

    :marked
      ```yaml
      # Default .zunit.yml contents
      tap: false
      directories:
        tests: tests
        output: tests/_output
        support: tests/_support
      ```

      ### tap

      Enables [TAP](http://testanything.org) compatible output from the test runner. This can be overridden by passing the `--tap` CLI option.

  feature.bump
    :marked
      ```yaml
      # Output will be TAP compatible
      tap: true
      ```

      ### directories

      Sets the paths for directories used by ZUnit.
      * `tests` sets the directory in which tests are found.
      * `output` sets the directory in which reports will be generated.
      * `support` sets the directory in which support files can be found.

      ```yaml
      directories:
        tests: tests
        output: tests/_output
        support: tests/_support
      ```

      ### time_limit

      If a `time_limit` is set, your tests will be run within an asynchronous process, and terminated if they run for longer than the specified time.

      > **NOTE**: Due to the way child processes are handled in earlier versions of ZSH, the `time_limit` setting is ignored for ZSH versions below **5.1.0**. This is necessary because in versions below **5.1.0**, the exit state is never returned from the asynchronous process, which would cause tests to hang indefinitely.

    :marked
      ```yaml
      # Tests will be terminated if they
      # run for longer than 5 seconds
      time_limit: 5
      ```
